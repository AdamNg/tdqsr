Note the initial code is presented in a pdf file without specifying dependencies or python modules imported. This submission is using python 3.8+, with my inferred package dependencies refactoring the starting code under [source.base](./source/base/__init__.py).

To run my submission:
- Run the demo notebook [submission.ipynb](submission.ipynb) 
- (Or equivalently) Run the script equivalent [submission.py](submission.py).

My submission is under [source.demo](./source/demo):
- Extended Broker class enabling debug logging [position.py](./source/demo/position.py)
- Extended Broker class enabling debug logging, allow for (de)leverage long-short scenario, and trading beyond initialized securities [broker.py](./source/demo/broker.py)
- Some utility function for this submission (json read / cache) [utility.py](./source/demo/util.py)
- Submission of the RebalancingSystem [rebalancing_system.py](./source/demo/rebalancing_system.py)
